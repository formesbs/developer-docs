# Current Solutions

### Public Address

Groups are created by the ownership of assets by a single Public Address

### Smart Contracts

1. ERC-20 - group fungible tokens by contract id
2. ERC-712 - group non-fungible tokens by contract id/address
3. ERC-1155 - group non-fungible tokens by schemas

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

Group assets by the ownership of a single smart contract
